# web_scraping_project_testcricket-data
 I recently took on a web scraping project using Selenium 4 to extract data from how stat. With advanced features, I automated the process of collecting data.This saved me time and effort while providing valuable insights into the platform's content.

 ## Steps involved in the process
 step 1: scrape data from 1991 to 2019 from the howstat website using selenium web driver.
 step 2: scrape data from 2020 to 2023 from the howstat website using the same selenium web driver.
 step 3: combine data using the csv files to form a single csv file.
 
 ## Libraries used
 pandas
 time
 selenium
 csv
 
 ## Tools used
 Jupyter notebook
 Chrome web driver

 ## Conclusion
 Scraping test cricket data from 1991 to 2023 was done using the jupyter notebook and chrome web driver into a single csv file.
